This semgrep rule is designed to identify potential misuse of the `env::set_contract_storage` function. 

The rule consists of several patterns that are combined using logical operators (pattern-inside, pattern-not-inside). 
The first pattern (pattern-inside) matches a function definition that has a parameter $IK of some type $T. 
The function may have other parameters and a function body, which are not relevant for this rule.

The second and third patterns (pattern-not-inside) are used to exclude certain conditions that could authorize 
the use of `set_contract_storage` by anyone other than the contract owner. 

The fourth pattern (pattern) matches a call to the env::set_contract_storage function, passing the variable $IK as the first argument. 
This function is used to write data to the contract storage, which can be critical for the contract's integrity.
If the pattern matches and no authorization condition is found, a warning message is issued.
