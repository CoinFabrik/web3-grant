We prioritize analysis on issues that appear on deployed projects or audits.


## Methodology

We have three sources for candidate for examples to be detected (detectors):

1. Audits of Substrate Polkadot projects by auditing companies. In order to get candidates we look at the audit's findings and the associated github repo.

2. Deployed ink! projects.

3. [Analysis Categories](https://blog.coinfabrik.com/analysis-categories/). We generate examples from classic examples in other blockchains.
